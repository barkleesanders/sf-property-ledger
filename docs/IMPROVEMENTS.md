# Improvement backlog

Living list for the twice-weekly improvement loop. Check items off as they
land; append new findings at the bottom with dates. Never silently resolve a
disagreement — preserve it as a recorded conflict instead.

## Open

- [ ] **web/ ServiceAdapter (dev-server only)**: per-request CLI spawns reload
  the indexes (~31s measured on the VM 2026-10-03); the 15-min/Infinity
  in-process cache already mitigates repeat hits. Production never uses this
  path (Workers serve the precomputed R2 bundle — see superseded item below),
  so this is local-dev ergonomics only. Optimize (persistent subprocess or
  socket) only if dev iteration latency becomes a bottleneck.
- [ ] **Coverage**: raise test coverage for `queries.py` edge cases —
  T-block handling, orphan parcel identifiers, retired-parcel relationships.

## Landed

- 2026-09-29: initial commit — waves 1–4 harvesters, linkage, audit,
  hash-pinned manifests, CONTRACT.md, research brief.
- 2026-09-29: Wave 1 manifest drift reconciled through the harvester
  (commit 401ac0a) — resume path refreshes `expected_rows` from the live
  count; manifest now 551,358 = 551,358.
- 2026-09-29: Wave 4 audit script defects fixed (commit 401ac0a) —
  parcel block set keyed on `block_num`, anomaly guard catches 7148COMA;
  full audit rerun green.
- 2026-09-29: supervisor nested-logdir test written and passing
  (commit 401ac0a), incl. negative control.
- 2026-09-29: Wave 5a landing (commit 522c136) — typed service layer,
  CLI (7/7 commands), MCP (7 tools), 38/38 tests against real data.
- 2026-09-30: Wave 5b landing (commit 401ac0a) — Hono web app deployed to
  Cloudflare Workers production
  (https://sf-property-ledger.barkleesanders.workers.dev); parity 17/17,
  deterministic builds, R2-backed routes verified live.
- 2026-10-03: web/ ServiceAdapter "optimize before public launch" item
  SUPERSEDED — the public launch (2026-09-30) serves via bundle/R2 mode and
  never spawns the CLI per request (verified: no child_process in the worker
  path; live `/api/mode` returns `{"mode":"bundle"}`). ServiceAdapter is
  dev-server-only; rescoped as a dev-ergonomics item above.
- 2026-10-03: test_wave5.py guards repaired — the collection-time checks had
  been red since the 2026-09-29 REPAIR 1/2 runs (mtime-based "untouched"
  guard tripped by legitimate manifest/audit refreshes; drift assertion
  still expected the pre-repair +114). The drift check now pins the
  reconciled state (551,358 = 551,358, drift 0) and the data guard compares
  content hashes against the index manifest's pinned input sha256s instead
  of mtimes. Full suite green again.
